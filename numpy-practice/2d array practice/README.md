# 📌 NumPy Matrix Operations Practice

This repository contains basic NumPy matrix programs to practice indexing, slicing, conditional operations, and matrix computations.  
It is useful for Python and NumPy beginners.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Matrix creation using NumPy
- Row and column indexing
- Conditional filtering and replacement
- Diagonal and trace operations
- Matrix slicing
- Aggregation functions (sum, max, min)

- **matrix_row_column_ops.py**  
  Performs row-wise and column-wise sum, maximum, and minimum operations.

- **matrix_filter_modify.py**  
  Filters values using conditions and modifies matrix elements.

- **matrix_row_column_access.py**  
  Accesses specific rows and columns using NumPy indexing.

- **matrix_slicing.py**  
  Demonstrates slicing of sub-matrices from a larger matrix.

- **matrix_shape_indexing.py**  
  Displays matrix shape, elements, rows, and columns.

- **matrix_aggregation.py**  
  Calculates row and column sums, maximums, and minimums.
