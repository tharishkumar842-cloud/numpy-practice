# NumPy Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains **4 small Python projects** demonstrating the use of **NumPy** for real-world data analysis tasks such as scores, temperatures, sales, and marks processing.

## Project 1: Player Score Analysis
**Description:**
- Stores scores of multiple players across different games.
- Calculates total score for each player.
- Finds the player with the highest total score.
- Identifies games where average score is greater than 20.
- Replaces all scores below 15 with 0.

**Concepts Used:**
- NumPy arrays
- `sum()`, `mean()`, `argmax()`
- Boolean indexing

## Project 2: Temperature Analysis
**Description:**
- Stores daily temperature values.
- Finds highest, lowest, and average temperature.
- Converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- Sorts temperatures in ascending and descending order.

**Concepts Used:**
- `max()`, `min()`, `mean()`
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- `sort()`

## Project 3: Sales Data Analysis
**Description:**
- Stores weekly sales data of multiple products.
- Calculates total sales per product.
- Calculates total sales per day.
- Identifies the product with maximum total sales.
- Checks days where total sales exceeded 200.

**Concepts Used:**
- 2D NumPy arrays
- Axis-based operations
- `argmax()`
- Boolean conditions

## Project 4: Student Marks Analysis
**Description:**
- Stores student marks.
- Finds highest, lowest, and average marks.
- Sorts marks in ascending and descending order.

**Concepts Used:**
- Array statistics
- Sorting techniques
